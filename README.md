# Geo-Analytical Assessment of Urban Livability Metrics

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive analysis of socio-economic factors across 8 major cities in Canada, designed to assess livability based on criteria such as income, cost of living, crime rates, and healthcare access. The project leverages SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Excel PowerMap for geo-spatial visualization.

## Key Features

- **SQL Query-Based Analysis**: SQL queries were used to extract and combine data from multiple sources, including employment, cost of living, and crime statistics, allowing for a detailed comparison of cities.
  
- **Data Cleansing and ETL Processes**: Integrated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques to manage and cleanse data, ensuring accurate analysis of urban livability metrics.
  
- **PowerMap Visualization**: Developed a dynamic Excel PowerMap visualization to represent key metrics, offering an intuitive, geographical representation of the analyzed data.

- **Video Presentation**: Created a video walkthrough to showcase the findings, using a geo-spatial map to highlight the livability rankings of the cities.

## Technology Stack

- **SQL**: Data extraction and transformation, merging data from various sources.
- **Excel PowerMap**: Geo-spatial visualization of city metrics.
- **MP4 Video**: Presentation of findings.

## Project Deliverables

1. **SQL Query**: The SQL code used to extract and analyze data from the database.
2. **PowerMap Visualization**: An Excel file containing the PowerMap visualization of livability metrics.
3. **Video Tour**: A video presentation of the projectâ€™s findings.
4. **Final Report**: A detailed PDF report summarizing the analysis, methodology, and conclusions.

## How to Run

1. **SQL Query Execution**: Download and run the provided SQL query on your database, ensuring the correct data is imported into the relevant tables.
2. **PowerMap**: Open the provided Excel file to view the PowerMap visualization, with layers representing different livability factors.
3. **Video Tour**: Watch the MP4 video for a guided tour of the project results.

## Conclusion

This project identified Montreal as the top city for livability based on a balance of factors such as income, cost of living, and safety, despite some challenges in healthcare access (hospital wait times). The analysis serves as a valuable tool for decision-making, especially for students or professionals seeking a data-driven approach to choosing a city to live in.
